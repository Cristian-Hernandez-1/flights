# movie and tv show recommendations

This program helps you decide what to watch. It requests input on whether the user wants to watch a tv show or movie. Then it will ask on what streaming platform. The program relies on csv files that contain movies and tv shows on 4 different streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+). The files can be found in the media_data folder, it contains the two original files, and the two cleaned versions of the file for my use case.
